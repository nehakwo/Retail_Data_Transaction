# Retail_Data_Transaction

# Project Plan :- The aim of this project is to use Python, SQL, and Excel to analyze sales data and generate meaningful reports for a retail chain.

# Data Source 

This dataset includes the following fields :-

* TransactionID            : A unique identifier for each transaction
* TransactionTime          : The time the transaction took place
* ItemCode                 : The code of the item purchased
* ItemDescription          : A description of the item purchased
* NumberOfItemsPurchased   : The number of items purchased in the transaction
* CostPerItem              : The cost per item
* Country                  : The country where the transaction took place

# Phase 1 : Data Collection and Database Setup

1. Data Collection : Downloaded the data from Kaggle as a csv file and placed it on the proper path

2. Database Setup : Set up a SQL database to hold the data. Designed the database schema, and created the necessary tables using SQL DDL commands.

# Phase 2 : Data Cleaning and Preparation

1. Data Cleaning : Used SQL queries and Python (pandas) to clean the data. Look for and handle missing or inconsistent data, outliers, etc.

2. Data Preparation : Prepared the data for analysis. This may involve creating additional calculated fields, such as total sales value, month/year fields for time-based analysis, etc. Again, this can be done using a combination of SQL and Python

# Phase 3 : Data Analysis

1. Data Exploration: Used SQL queries and Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc) to explore the data and identify trends and patterns.

2. Advanced Analysis: Performed more complex analysis as needed. For example, time series analysis for sales trends, cohort analysis for customer behavior, etc. Python's advanced data analysis libraries can be very useful here.

# Phase 4 : Reporting

1. Report Preparation: Prepared reports summarizing the findings. These can include:

• Tabular Reports: Created summary tables showing sales by product, store, month, etc. These can be generated using SQL queries and Python, and then formatted and presented in Excel.

• Visual Reports: Created visual reports (charts, graphs, etc) showing trends and patterns. These can be created using Python's data visualization libraries, and then incorporated into Excel for presentation.

• Automated Reports: If needed, set up automated reports that run regularly and update Excel dashboards, using Python for automation.

2. Report Presentation: Presented the reports to in either your Excel dashboard or prepare a PPT to present the findings.
